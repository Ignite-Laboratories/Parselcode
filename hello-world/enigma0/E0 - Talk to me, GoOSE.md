# `E0 - Talk to me, GoOSE`

I've hit bedrock.

I don't think my shovel can dig any deeper, and that's one of the most relieving things I've ever written!

The foundation makes the house, and at bedrock the bits beneath shouldn't get swept away with the storm surge.

_**This must be the place.**_

Before we can start creating our foundation, we'll need to drive down some piles it can anchor against.  In a neural 
architecture, many routines need to be executed at a high rate of speed for "stable" emulation.  On top of 
that, those routines must be able to mutate aspects of anonymous structures without hard type requirements. Lastly - 
they must speak of the same simulation, in a thread-safe manner, all in good timing.

_I've already planned for these contingencies._

Our work is cut out for us, but we stand on the shoulders of _giants._  The Gods of language design - the 
architects behind _**Go**_ - have already set us up for utter success.

Thank you for joining me, weary Enigmaneer, on the road to regaining our own skills!

### The Go Operating System Environment

The languages that describe neural emulation have yet to be written, only those needed to facilitate its existence.

An Operating System Environment is the abstraction that exists when orchestrating concurrent stable code.

Just as an Integrated Development Environment aids the _programmer_ in working within a host system, an Operating
System Environment aids the _program._

Think of it as a conductor's baton, signaling the strings to marshall in perfect timing with the bells and whistles
to perform a symphony of synchronous code.

This enigma will document my progress in constructing what I believe are the necessary piles to support neural emulation's
foundation.

### Emulation?

Yes.

I refuse to dance around the point.

The goal, for me, has always been to recreate our psyches - _in code._

The mystery of what that means to You is what inspires me the most =)
